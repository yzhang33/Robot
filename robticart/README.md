# Robotic Art
Robotic art to me does not have to be installations using technologies and sensors. There could be many more forms of robotic art. One that comes to my mind is a robot painting an art piece. Recently, along with the advancement of technologies, robotic arms have unprecedented progress. However, using robotic arms to draw paintings is even more exciting. In tech, just using a robotic arm to pick up a brush could be a Ph.D.'s thesis. Imagining use it to draw certain paintings is impossible. 

## Drawing Claude Monet

Hello, Computer created a robotic artist that takes inspiration from the impressionist brushstrokes and style of painter Claude Monet.

It takes photos of people's shirts and uses those shirts' colors to draw the painting. Watching the arm paint is already an enjoyment and the painting looks fantastic which is shocking to me. 

It is amazing to see how art and tech are used and created an art piece. And this created a new path for our future art.

## The Rain Room

Random Internationals created a piece called the Rain Room back 2012. This piece carried the idea to incroprate technologies into art installation and created a new experience for viewers. 

This site-specific sound and light installation uses 2,500 litres of self-cleaning recycled water, controlled through a system of 3D tracking cameras placed around the ceiling. The cameras detect a visitor's movement and signal groups of the water nozzles in the ceiling, stopping the flow of water in a roughly six-foot radius around the person.

Robotic art does not have to be a physical robot. It could be an integenllegent machine that interacts wtih human.
